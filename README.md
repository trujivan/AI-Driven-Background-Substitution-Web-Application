# AI-Driven-Background-Substitution-Web-Application

!Background Editing

In the digital age, manipulating images has become increasingly sophisticated. From simple filters to complex deep learning algorithms, the tools available to alter images are vast and powerful. One such advancement is the combination of Stable Diffusion and Self-Attention Mechanism (SAM), which allows for the seamless swapping of backgrounds in images.

## Introduction to the Project

The objective of this project is to develop a user-friendly web application that leverages the capabilities of Stable Diffusion and SAM to replace backgrounds in images. The process involves several key steps:

1. **Background Segmentation**: Using SAM, we identify and isolate the subject in the image by generating a segmentation mask.
2. **Inpainting**: The background is replaced with a new image generated based on a text prompt using Stable Diffusion.
3. **Interactive Web Interface**: The entire process is encapsulated in an intuitive web application, allowing users to upload images, specify text prompts, and visualize the results in real-time.

## Implementation Details

To achieve our goals, we utilize various Python libraries and pre-trained models:

- **Diffusers**: A library providing access to stable diffusion models for generating images from text prompts.
- **Gradio**: A user-friendly library for creating web interfaces for machine learning models.
- **Transformers**: A library providing state-of-the-art natural language processing models.
- **PyTorch**: A deep learning framework for building and training neural networks.
